# About
This is my little showcase-my-abilities project. 
First, it was a simple page for news searching, powered by NewsAPI.
This version could be found in `news` branch.

But, as NewsAPI is a free service, it has some limitations. 
And as Frontend lover, I couldn't stand to not be able to deploy my project.

So, I decided to find a new content to show here.

# How it's done
It's powered by [National Stolen Art File API](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-crime). 
You can search for stolen art by title or just browse them randomly. 
Maybe, you'll find something interesting.

I used React, Redux, TypeScript and Tailwind for this project.

Favicon of this project was made with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) using [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) from Twitter (X).
